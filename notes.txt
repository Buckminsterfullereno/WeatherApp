4.all inputs returned error404. this is because the fetch instruction was missing "https://"

5.humidity and winspeed wouldn't display. this is because index.js had to errors

	line 28 error404.classList.add("fadeIn"); instead of "add" it should be "remove"
	line68  weatherDetails.classList.add("FadeIn"); instead of "FadeIn" it should be "fadeIn"
